          <li>Buying our first home was a really daunting thought - we never expected to be able to afford a mortgage in the next few years. Nevertheless, we decided to meet with Australian Credit Corporation and now we are so glad we did! ACC helped us to assess our financial situation and show us how to make it happen. They supported us wholeheartedly through the whole buying process. Their extensive knowledge of the lending business combined with their approachable nature and personal touch made them a pleasure to deal with. We now refer everyone we know to ACC.<br><br><strong><i>R. Castle and C. Mead</i></strong></li>

          <li>I thought with my previous knowledge that I had a pretty fair handle on lending, however 12 years is a long time to be out of any business and I was impressed by Markus' knowledge of his product as well as his empathy for his potential client at the time. <br><br>

          We have been with Markus for approximately 3 years now and like most over the last couple of years we have had to go back to the well, each time Markus has made the process quick and painless and I genuinely thank him for his efforts.<br><br><strong><i>Mr & Mrs Holland</i></strong></li>

          <li>The team at Australian Credit Corporation were extremely helpful in refinancing our business line of credit. Not only were they helpful, but responsive to our every question in a timely manner, they explained everything we needed to know and answered questions when we needed to ask.<br><br><strong><i>Mr D. James</i></strong></li>
